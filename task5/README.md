write a small web app that does the following:

    - defines an array of numbers (positive, negative and zeros).
    
    - for each number in the array display the following: "(number) is even||odd"
    - example:
    
        * array = [1, 10, 3]
        
        * result should be:
        
            1 is odd
            
            10 is even
            
            3 is odd
