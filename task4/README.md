write a small web app that does the following:

    - defines an array of 20 number (positive, negative and zeros) and displayes the largest number.
    
    - you can define the array directly in the code and fill it with 20 numbers. (i.e. no need for user input)
    
    - the result should look like this: "The largest number is (the number)".
